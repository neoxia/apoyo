# Apoyo

This is a mono-repository containing all packages for the npm `@apoyo` namespace.

Apoyo (Spanish for "support") tries to improve Developer Experience by giving the developer a wide range of utility packages:

- Some packages, such as `@apoyo/std` will be framework agnostic.
- Some packages, such as `@apoyo/decoders`, may provide an alternative to existing solutions.
- Some packages, such as `@apoyo/csv`, may provide an overlay to an existing package, with additional utilities to improve or facilitate the usage of the library.

## Packages

- [Std](packages/std) (`@apoyo/std`): Contains general, framework agnostic utilities.
- TODO: Decoders (`@apoyo/decoders`): Contains type decoders and validators.
- TODO: CSV (`@apoyo/csv`): Based on `papaparse`, this package contains additional CSV related utilities.
